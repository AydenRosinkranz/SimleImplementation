# SimleImplementation

This simulated tic tac toe game is composed of 3 parts

First: configuration, including steps of settling your players and the board(normally 3 rows and 3 columns)

Second the most important: MCST logical part, which I didnt implement well, because today Im gonna hang out outside.

Last the running part. Not mention everyone can tell from at the first glance.

Checkmate.
